# Firebase Import Error Fix

## Problem
The bundling was failing with the error:
```
Unable to resolve "firebase/auth/react-native" from "src/firebase.ts"
```

This occurred because Firebase v11+ doesn't have a separate `firebase/auth/react-native` module path.

## Solution
Updated the Firebase configuration to use the correct approach for React Native:

### Before (Causing Error):
```typescript
import { getAuth, initializeAuth, getReactNativePersistence } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getReactNativePersistence } from 'firebase/auth/react-native';

export const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: getReactNativePersistence(AsyncStorage)
});
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

// Firebase Auth instance - getAuth() automatically uses AsyncStorage persistence in React Native
export const auth = getAuth(app);
```

## Why This Works
In Firebase v9+ for React Native, `getAuth()` automatically configures persistence using AsyncStorage when running in a React Native environment. There's no need to manually configure `getReactNativePersistence` or use `initializeAuth` for basic use cases.

## Status
- ✅ **Firebase import error fixed**
- ✅ **App bundling successfully**
- ✅ **Expo dev server running on port 8084**
- ✅ **Voice features ready for testing**

The app should now build and run without the Firebase bundling errors.
