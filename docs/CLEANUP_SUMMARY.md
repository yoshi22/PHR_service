# Code Cleanup and Reorganization Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Firebase Test Files Consolidation
- Created comprehensive Firebase test utilities in `src/utils/firebaseTestUtils.js` with functions for:
  - Firebase initialization
  - Test user creation and authentication 
  - Security rules testing
  - Test data cleanup
- Created a consolidated test runner in `src/utils/runFirebaseTests.js`
- Created a dedicated cleanup utility in `src/utils/cleanupFirebaseTests.js`
- Simplified package.json scripts from 8 to 4 entries for Firebase testing
- Moved redundant test files to backup directory

### 2. Context Implementation Consolidation
- Moved `AuthContext.tsx` from `src/contexts` to `src/context` to standardize location
- Updated all imports in dependent files
- Made the project's context management more consistent
  
### 3. Debug Files Cleanup
- Removed redundant `firestore.rules.debug` file (moved to backup)
- Kept `firestore.rules.dev-only` for development purposes

### 4. Empty Files Cleanup
- Removed empty test files that were no longer needed
- Preserved important utility files like `formatDate.ts`

## Project Structure Improvements

1. **Unified Context Directory**: All context providers are now in `src/context/` directory
2. **Consolidated Test Utilities**: Firebase testing utilities are now organized in fewer files
3. **Backup Organization**: Deprecated files are properly archived instead of deleted
4. **Simplified Scripts**: Package.json now has cleaner and more focused test scripts

## Next Steps

1. **Review Component Empty Files**: Many component files appear empty and might need implementation
2. **Consider Merging Backup Directories**: `/backup` and `/src/utils/backup` could be consolidated
3. **Test the Consolidated Firebase Utils**: Verify all Firebase test utilities work as expected
4. **Add Documentation**: Consider adding more comments to the consolidated test utilities
