# Activity Tracker Integration in AdvancedSettings - COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully moved the activity tracker section from its fixed scroll position in ProfileScreen to be properly integrated within the AdvancedSettings component at the bottom of the advanced settings section.

## Changes Made

### 1. AdvancedSettings Component (`src/components/AdvancedSettings.tsx`)
- **Added Activity Tracker Props Interface**: Extended the `AdvancedSettingsProps` interface with all necessary activity tracker properties:
  - `miBandConnected`, `miBandSteps`, `miBandHeartRate`, `miBandLastSync`
  - `appleWatchConnected`, `appleWatchSupported`, `appleWatchData`, `appleWatchLastSync`
  - `fitbitConnected`, `fitbitData`, `fitbitLastSync`
  - Navigation handlers: `onMiBandSetup`, `onAppleWatchSetup`, `onFitbitSetup`, `onSyncData`

- **Added Activity Tracker Section**: Integrated the complete activity tracker UI at the bottom of advanced settings, positioned before the "Expert Settings" section:
  - Mi Band connection status and data display
  - Apple Watch connection status, sync button, and data display
  - Fitbit connection status, sync button, and data display
  - Each tracker shows connection status, latest data, and last sync time

- **Added Activity Tracker Styles**: Added all necessary styles for tracker components:
  - `trackerItem`, `trackerHeader`, `trackerInfo`, `trackerTextContainer`
  - `trackerName`, `trackerStatus`, `trackerActions`, `syncButton`
  - `setupButton`, `setupButtonText`, `trackerData`, `dataText`, `syncTime`

### 2. ProfileScreen (`src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`)
- **Updated AdvancedSettings Props**: Extended the AdvancedSettings component call to include all activity tracker props with proper type handling:
  - Null safety with `|| undefined` for `miBandSteps` and `miBandHeartRate`
  - Date conversion with `?.getTime()` for sync timestamps
  - All navigation handlers passed correctly

- **Removed Old Activity Tracker Section**: Completely removed:
  - The separate ScrollView container for activity trackers
  - All individual tracker components (Mi Band, Apple Watch, Fitbit)
  - All related styles (`scrollContainer`, `section`, `trackerItem`, etc.)

### 3. Code Quality & Type Safety
- **Type Safety**: Proper handling of null values from hooks converted to undefined for React props
- **Interface Compliance**: All props properly typed and documented
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved, just relocated
